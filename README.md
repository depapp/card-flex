# :computer: how to setup
## on your local machine
before we get started, please note that you have to install `nodejs` including `npx` to run this cli-tools.
- first, open your terminal and run the following command to initialize the project:
```bash
npx card-flex
```
- the previous command will prompt you with a series of questions. answer them as required to configure your name-card
- make sure there's no error. if you get an error, please write on this [link](https://github.com/depapp/card-flex/issues/new)
- it will create new folder/directory based on your `GitHub username` that you provide before
- change the directory using this command
```bash
cd <your-github-username>
```
- open your name-card locally using
```bash
npm run dev
```
you should be able to see your own cli-based name-card locally

## public on "npmjs"
next step we will make it public using [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com), so people can access your cli-based name-card by using `npx <your-github-username>`. \

```bash
npm login
```
- follow the prompt to login to your account

```bash
npm publish
